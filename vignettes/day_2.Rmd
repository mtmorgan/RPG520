# Overview

We use two case studies today. The studies are used to illustrate the
data manipulation and statistical analysis tasks that one might expect
in day-to-day wet- or dry-lab work in computational oncology.

We will use functions from the [dplyr][] package to manage our
data. [dplyr][] is is a key package in a particular approach to data
management in *R* called the 'tidyverse'. Tidy analysis uses a
standard data structure (a `tibble`) and relatively small number
functions to provide an effective way to accomplish many tasks.

Start by loading the [dplyr][] package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

Functions for 'tidy' data management include:

- `filter()` -- filter data to contain specific rows.
- `select()` -- select a subset of columns.
- `mutate()` -- change or add columns.

Example functions to summarize data:

- `count()` -- simple count of entries in each column.
- `summarize()` -- e.g., `mean()` or `var()`iance of one or more columns.
- `group_by()` -- summarize data by group.

[tidyr][] and other packages complement basic functionality

- `tidyr::pivot_wider()` -- change a 'long' table to a 'wide'
  table. See example below.

We will use the [readr][] package to read data from disk into *R*.

[tidyr][] and [readr][] are used less commonly, so we do not load them
into our *R* session yet.

For visualization, we use [ggplot2][]; details are provided below.

Finally, for statistical functions we use the 'stats' package
distributed with *R*.

# US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data

We use data from the US Center for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System ([BRFSS][]) annual survey. Check out the
web page for a little more information. We are using a small subset of
this data, including a random sample of 20000 observations from each
of 1990 and 2010.

## Data input

Use `file.choose()` to find the 'BRFSS-subset.csv' file on the CCR file
system.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
brfss_file_path <- system.file(package = "RPG520", "extdata", "BRFSS-subset.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
brfss_file_path <- file.choose() # look for 'Rpg520/week-04/extdata/BRFSS-subset.csv'
```

Take a peak at the data using the `readLines()` function to read the
first 3 lines of data, and `cat("\n")` to print the result to the terminal

```{r}
readLines(brfss_file_path, 3) |>
    cat(sep = "\n")
```

The file is a 'comma-separated value' file. These files can be created
by, for instance, using Excel's 'Export' menu. The first line consists
of column headers, separated by a comma. Subsequent lines represent
rows of data, again with a comma separating columns.

Read the entire dataset into *R* with the command
`readr::read_csv()`. Assign the data to a variable `brfss`.

```{r}
brfss <- readr::read_csv(brfss_file_path)
brfss
```

## Initial cleaning

The data are pretty simple, but two small changes will make it more
useful. Both 'Sex' and 'Year' are really `factor` values (each can
only take on specific levels, 'Female' and 'Male' for 'Sex', and
'1990' and '2010' for 'Year').

### Mutate

A factor can be created from an ordinary vector `x` with code like the
following:

```{r}
x <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", NA)
factor(x, levels = c("Female", "Male"))

y <- c(2010, 1991, 1990, NA)
factor(y, levels = c("1990", "2010"))
```

Use the dplyr `mutate()` function to change 'Sex' and 'Year' to
factors.

```{r}
brfss |>
    mutate(
        Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c("Female", "Male")),
        Year = factor(Year, levels = c("1990", "2010"))
    )
```

That looks like it's working, save the updated data set

```{r}
brfss <-
    brfss |>
    mutate(
        Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c("Female", "Male")),
        Year = factor(Year, levels = c("1990", "2010"))
    )
```

## Data exploration

A good place to start with an analysis is basic data
exploration. Perhaps the most straight-forward thing to do is count
the number of observations in each year.

### Count

```{r}
brfss |>
    count(Year)
```

The data has been chosen so that each year has the same number of
individuals. What about the number of females and males in each year?
This is determined by responses to the survey, reflecting the relative
number of males and females in the population, or at least responding
to the survey.

```{r}
brfss |>
    count(Sex)
```

What about the number of each sex in each year? Use `count()` with two
(or more) column names

```{r}
brfss |>
    count(Sex, Year)
```

It seems like there are more Female respondents in 2010 than
in 1990. Use [tidyr][]'s function `pivot_wider()` (remember to look at
the help page `?pivot_wider` for details on how this function works)
to pivot the 'Sex' column entries to column names.

```{r}
brfss |>
    count(Sex, Year) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "Sex", values_from = "n")
```

### Summarize

We used `tidyr::pivot_wider()` instead of just `pivot_wider()`. This
notation means 'use the [tidyr][] package, and a function in that
package called `pivot_wider()`. This notation to avoid conflicts if
two packages have a function named `pivot_wider()`; it also has
additional benefits related to managing *R*'s `.GlobalEnv`, but that
is a more advanced topic.

Use `summarize()` for summaries more complicated than simple counts

```{r}
brfss |>
    summarize(
        avg_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_wt = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_ht = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

Nothing too exciting here, except to perhaps note the use of metric
system Weight (kg) and Height (cm).

The function `mean()` calculates the average of the corresponding
column. `na.rm = TRUE` tells the function to remove `NA` (missing)
values before calculating the mean. This is kind of
interesting. Suppose one had a vector and calculated the mean

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 5)
mean(x)
```

No surprises. What if one of the values in `x` were missing? The logic
used by *R* is that the missing value could be *any* number, so the
mean could be *anything* -- if there's an unknown value, then the mean
must also be unknown!

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, NA)
mean(x)
```

Often we would like to calculate the mean after removing the unknown
values, and this is what the `na.rm = TRUE` argument does

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Group

Back to our data exploration, we might expect the average age, weight,
and height to be different between Female and Male respondents, and
perhaps also between years. Use `group_by()` to calculate summaries by
Sex and Year

```{r}
brfss |>
    group_by(Sex, Year) |>
    summarize(
        avg_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_wt = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_ht = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

This shows some interesting aspects of the data. Males are on average
15cm taller than females; there is no difference in average height
between years.

The average age of both Female and Male respondents is greater in 2010
than in 1990. This likely reflects changing demographics, as the 'baby
boom' cohort ages. Note that the average Female age changes by about
10.9 years, whereas the average Male age changes by about 12.3 years;
perhaps this reflects different life expectancy of males and females.

Also interesting is that the average weight changes, by about 8.2 kg
(18 lbs) for Female respondents, 7.6 kg (16.7 lbs) for Males. This
could be because people in general have become heavier, or that older
people are heavier than younger people (or for other reasons not
captured in the data).

### Filter

Use `filter()` to create a subset of the data containing only 2010
respondents, and another subset containing only Male respondents.

```{r}
brfss_2010 <-
    brfss |>
    filter(Year == "2010")

brfss_male <-
    brfss |>
    filter(Sex == "Male")
```

## Visual exploration

We will use the [ggplot2][] package to visually explore our data. We
use several functions from this package, so load it into our *R*
session.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

[ggplot2][] constructs plots by adding layers. Layers have different
roles. The plot starts with the specification of the data set to be
plotted...

### Aesthetics & geometries: box plot, histogram, density plot

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(brfss_2010)
```

...and then *adds* the 'aesthetics' (columns to be used for X and Y
axes, how to color points, etc)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Sex, y = Weight)
```

...and finally one or more 'geometries' ('geom') that describe the
geometric relationship between the x and y aesthetics. One geom is
`geom_boxplot()`, which draws a box-and-whiskers plot.

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Sex, y = Weight) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

The bar in the figure is the median weight, the box represents upper
and lower quartile of the data, the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the
inter-quartile range. Points outside the whiskers represent potential
outliers. The figure shows the difference in Female and Male weights,
as well as a skew in the weight distribution of both Female and Male
respondents.

Another way to view this sort of data is as a histogram...

```{r}
brfss_2010 |> filter(Sex == "Male") |>
    ggplot() +
    aes(x = Weight) +
    geom_histogram(col = "white")
```

... or when comparing distributions as a density plot

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Weight, color = Sex) +
    geom_density()
```

For subsequent work, note that log-transformed Weight reduces the most extreme values so the distribution is more Normal.

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = log10(Weight), color = Sex) +
    geom_density()
```

### Scatter plots

Presumably taller people are heavier than shorter people. Replace
'Sex' with 'Height' in `aes()`, and replace `geom_boxplot()` with
`geom_point()` to generate a scatter plot showing this relationship

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Height, y = Weight) +
    geom_point()
```

Yes there looks like a relationship. Add `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`
to fit a smoothed relationship to the points; `method = "lm"`
indicates that the smoothed line should be a linear regression.

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Height, y = Weight) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The relationship between height and weight likely depends on sex. Add
`color = Sex` to the `aes()` argument, so each geom (both points and
smoothed line) is colored by Sex.

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_2010) +
    aes(x = Height, y = Weight, color = Sex) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The lines cover the range of values for each sex; the relationship
between height and weight appears slightly steeper for males than
females.

Has the relationship between height and weight of males changed
between 1990 and 2010? Change the dataset to `brfss_male`, color by
`Year`, and add a title to the plot so that we know a little bit more
about the relationship. Also, explore a data transformation by using
the log of weight

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_male) +
    aes(x = Height, y = log10(Weight), color = Year) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "BRFSS Male Subset")
```

The figure suggests that 2010 males are heavier than 1990 males at all
heights, and hints that the relationship between weight and height is
steeper in 2010; a formal statistical analysis is required for further
confidence.

## Statistical analysis

This section illustrates basic statistical tests; it would be
interesting to sit down with a statistician to discuss the subtleties
of a more correct analysis.

### Difference between groups

Here is a partial summary of the `brfss_2010` data subset

```{r}
brfss_2010 |>
    group_by(Sex) |>
    summarize(
        n = n(),
        ave_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_wt = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
        ave_ht = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

Is there statistical support for the small difference between average
ages of Female and Male respondents?

Use `t.test()` to compare two groups. After studying the help page
`?t.test`, we use the 'formula' notation to test for differences in
Age as a function of Sex, `Age ~ Sex`, using the subset `brfss_2010`
as the data source.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
t <- t.test(Age ~ Sex, brfss_2010)
```

```{r}
t.test(Age ~ Sex, brfss_2010)
```

The summary reports (at the bottom) mean ages of Male and Female
respondents consistent with our own calculations, so we know we have
not made some kind of serious blunder in formulating the test. The
*t*-statistic of `r t$statistic`, with P-value `r t$p.value` is
significant.

What about differences in Male Weight between 1990 and 2010?

```{r}
t.test(Weight ~ Year, brfss_male)
```

Conversation with a statistician might make us concerned about whether
assumptions of the *t*-test are fully satisfied, e.g., the data are
supposed to be normally distributed, but as we saw in the box plots
weights are skewed. We could try to transform the data (formal
approaches to assess appropriateness of data transformations are
available), e.g., by using log Weight

```{r}
t.test(log10(Weight) ~ Year, brfss_male)
```

Or we might use a statistic like the Wilcoxon test that makes fewer
assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution.

```{r}
wilcox.test(Weight ~ Year, brfss_male)
```

Regardless of the details of the analysis, the difference in Male
Weight between 1990 and 2010 is highly significant.

### Linear regression

The 'BRFSS Male Subset' figure shows linear relations between the
square root of Weight and Height in each year.

```{r}
ggplot(brfss_male) +
    aes(x = Height, y = log10(Weight), color = Year) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "BRFSS Male Subset")
```

How would we calculate this regression, and assess its significance?
We focus on Male 2010 data.

```{r}
brfss_male_2010 <-
    brfss_male |>
    filter(Year == "2010")
```

The answer is to fit a linear regression to the data. In *R*, this is
done by fitting a linear model (`lm()`) and then summarizing the
result. 

```{r}
## fit the linear model
fit <- lm(log10(Weight) ~ Height, brfss_male_2010)

## summarize the fit, including a statistical assessment of the fit
summary(fit)
```

The ANOVA table shows that the relationship is highly significant. The
'Adjusted R-squared' value indicates that about 17% of the variation in
Weight is accounted for by Height. The estimated coefficient
associated with Height is the slope of the line, indicating that the
square root of Weight increases by about `r fit$coefficients[2]` for
every increase in Height of 1 cm.

As an aside, one might hope that `plot(fit)` would plot the regression
line. Actually, it creates a series of diagnostic plots that help us
assess the appropriateness of our choice of a linear model for
describing this data.

More advanced analysis using *R* to test, e.g., for differences in the
intercept or slope of the regression in 1990 versus 2010 are
straight-forward to implement, but require more sophisticated
statistical understanding.

# Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)

This data set is from an old microarray experiment investigating acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (PMID [14684422][], [16243790][]; the data
has been extracted from the [ALL][] *Bioconductor* package).  We focus
on phenotypes of 128 patients.

[14684422]: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2003-09-3243
[16243790]: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-04-2165

## Data input

What is a 'csv' file?

```{r, include = FALSE}
all_file <- system.file(package = "RPG520", "extdata", "ALL.csv")
all <- readr::read_csv(all_file)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
all_file <- file.choose()
all <- readr::read_csv(all_file)
```

```{r}
glimpse(all)
```

## Exploration & cleaning

For simplicity we focus on the following columns:

- 'cod' is a unique identifier
- 'sex'. We will recode this to a factor with levels 'Female' and
  'Male', so that there is no ambiguity about its meaning.
- 'age'.
- 'BT' represents B- or T- cell status. It is too fine-grained, so we
  will recode this to a new variable 'BorT'.
- 'mol.biol' summarizes status with respect to chromosomal status. We
  will filter the data to contain only patients with values 'BCR/ABL'
  (the classic BCR / ABL inversion) or 'NEG' (no chromosomal
  changes). We will recode the result as a factor with levels
  'BCR/ABL' and 'NEG'.

### `select()`

Use `select()` to select just the columns of interest. Re-assign the
result to `all`.

```{r}
all <-
    all |>
    select(cod, sex, age, BT, mol.biol)
```

### `ifelse()` and `factor()`

'sex' is currently a character vector with two values 'F' and 'M', as
well as missing values

```{r}
all |>
    count(sex)
```

We can remove individuals whose sex is unknown using
`filter(!is.na(sex))`.  Use `ifelse()` to translate 'F' and 'M' to
'Female' and 'Male', and then `factor()` so that this column is a
factor

```{r}
all  |>
    filter(!is.na(sex)) |>
    mutate(
        sex = factor(
            ifelse(sex == "F", "Female", "Male"),
            levels = c("Female", "Male")
        )
    )
```

### `startsWith()`

The `BT` column describes whether individuals have B- or T-cell
ALL. There are several different grades of each.

```{r}
all |>
    count(BT)
```

We are interested in simplifying this to just two values, 'B' or 'T',
based on the first letter of each vector element. The `startsWith()`
function returns `TRUE` each time an element of the first argument
starts with the second argument.

```{r}
x <- c("B", "B1", "T")
startsWith(x, "B")
```

We can combine this with `ifelse()` and `factor()` to mutate `BT`

```{r}
all |>
    mutate(
        BT = factor(
            ifelse(startsWith(BT, "B"), "B", "T"),
            levels = c("B", "T")
        )
    )
```

### `%in%`

'mol.biol' is also a character vector with several different values.

```{r}
all |>
    count(mol.biol)
```

We will filter `all` to only include 'BCR/ABL' or 'NEG' samples using
`%in%`. `%in%` is an 'infix' operator (like `~`) with a left-hand side
and a right-hand side. The left-hand side is a vector of values that
we are interested in. The right-hand side is also a vector, and
represents a (mathematical) 'set' of values. `%in%` asks, for each
element of the left-hand size, if the element is a member of the set
on the right hand side.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x %in% c(2, 5)
```

Filtering the `all` dataset is accomplished with

```{r}
all |>
    filter(mol.biol %in% c("BCR/ABL", "NEG"))
```

Re-coding the filtered values of 'mol.biol' uses `factor()` in a way
that we have already seen with 'sex'.

### Data cleaning pipeline

Putting these filtering and re-coding steps together, our initial
cleaning results in

```{r}
all_subset <-
    all |>
    ## columns of interest
    select(cod, sex, age, BT, mol.biol) |>
    ## rows of interest
    filter(
        !is.na(sex),
        mol.biol %in% c("BCR/ABL", "NEG")
    ) |>
    ## re-coding sex, mol.bio, BT
    mutate(
        sex = factor(
            ifelse(sex == "F", "Female", "Male"),
            levels = c("Female", "Male")
        ),
        BT = factor(
            ifelse(startsWith(BT, "B"), "B", "T"),
            levels = c("B", "T")
        ),
        mol.biol = factor(mol.biol, levels = c("BCR/ABL", "NEG"))
    )
```

## Data exploration

A basic characterize of our subset might group by sex and summarize
the number and average age of each group.

```{r}
all_subset |>
    group_by(sex) |>
    summarize(
        n = n(),
        av_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

There are about twice as many Male as Female samples; the average age
of Female samples is about 4 years older than Male samples.

We can visualize the distribution of ages in several ways, as
illustrated in the previous case study. Here we create a box plot with
`geom_boxplot()`, then overlay the individual points using
`geom_jitter()` (this geom displays each point but with a bit of
'jitter' away from its actual value -- instead of being plotted
exactly on the 'Female' or 'Male' line, the points are offset a random
amount).

```{r}
ggplot(all_subset) +
    aes(x = sex, y = age) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(width = .2)
```

The following table counts the number of 'BCR/ABL' and 'NEG' among
'Female' and 'Male' samples; it seems like there is a disproportionate
number of 'Male' 'NEG' (chromosomally normal) individuals.

```{r}
all_subset |>
    count(mol.biol, sex) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "sex", values_from = "n")
```

Here is a similar tally of B- and T-cell ALL for 'Female' and 'Male' samples

```{r}
all_subset |>
    count(BT, sex) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "sex", values_from = "n")
```

... and a count of 'BT' and 'mol.biol' by sex

```{r}
all_subset |>
    count(BT, mol.biol, sex) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "sex", values_from = "n")
```

Note that there are not T-cell, BCR/ABL samples. Is this for
biological reasons, or is an artifact of the procedures used in data
collection? Does it limit or bias the statistical questions that can
be asked?

## Statistical analysis

A *t*-test indicates that the difference in Male and Female age noted
above is not statistically significant

```{r}
t.test(age ~ sex, all_subset)
```

We noted differences in the number 'BCR/ABL' and 'NEG' samples with
respect to `sex`. A Chi-squared test can be used to assess whether
these differences are statistically significant. Look at the help page
`?chisq.test`. The idea is that the first argument is a vector of
observations of one variable (e.g., `mol.biol`) and the second
argument is the second variable (`sex`). Unlike `t.test`, there is no
`data=` argument, and no formula (`~`) interface. In base *R* one
might use `$` to access individual columns of a tibble, so the test
could be performed with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
chisq.test(all_subset$mol.biol, all_subset$sex)
```

A convenient variation of this is to use the function `with()`, which
allows one to write the test as

```{r}
all_subset |>
    with(chisq.test(mol.biol, sex))
```

The P-value indicates that the differences in counts of 'BCR/ABL' and
'NEG' observed between 'Female' and 'Male' are not statistically
supported. A similar conclusion applies with `BT` and `sex`.

```{r}
all_subset |>
    with(chisq.test(BT, sex))
```
